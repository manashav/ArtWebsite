		<h3> Principles of Design</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt> Principles of Design </dt>
				<dd>refer to the way that the elements are arranged in a unified whole and include unity, balance (symmetrical and asymetrical), contrast, rhythm, movement, emphasis and pattern. The principals of design help to coordinate the elements to produce effective visual results.</dd>
			<dt>Unity</dt>
				<dd> Visual unity is one of the most important aspects of well-designed art and is planned by the artist. Unity provides the cohesive quality that makes an artwork feel complete. </dd>
			<dt>Balance </dt>
				<dd>Balance refers to the distribution of visual weight in a work of art. In painting, it is the visual equilibrium of the elements that causes the total image to appear balanced. Balance can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical in a work of art </dd> 
			<dt>Contrast </dt>
				<dd> Contrast refers to differences in values, colours, textures, shapes, and other elements. Contrasts create visual excitement and add interest to the work. If all the art elements- values for example-are the same, the result is monotonous and unexciting.
			<dt>Movement </dt>
				<dd> Movement is used by artists to direct viewers though their work, often to a focal area. Such movement can be directed along lines, edges, shapes and colours, but moves the eye most easily on paths of equal value. </dd>
			<dt> Rhythm</dt>
				<dd> Rhythm is the repetition of visual movements- colours, shapes, or lines. Variety is essential to keep rhythms exciting and to avoid monotony. Movement and rhythm work together to create the visual equivalent of a musical beat.</dd>
			<dt> Emphasis</dt>
				<dd>Emphasis is used by artists to create dominance and focus in their work. Artists can emphasize colour, value, shapes or other art elements to achieve dominance. Various kinds of contrast can be used to emphasize a centre of interest. </dd>
			<dt> Pattern</dt>
				<dd>Pattern uses the art elements in planned or random repetitions to enhance surfaces of artwork. Patterns often occur in nature, and artists use similar repeated motifs to create pattern in their work. Pattern increases visual excitement by enriching surface interest.</dd>

		<h3> Elements of Design </h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Elements of Design </dt>
				<dd> are the content of most are activities: they include colour, line, value, texture, shape or form, and space.The elements of a design are the raw materials of an artist- the visual components of art.</dd>
			<dt> Colour</dt>
				<dd> Colour depends on light because it is made of light. There must be light for me s to see colour. A red shirt will not look red in the dark, where there is no light. The whiter the light, the more true colours will be. 
			Hue, value and intensity are the three main characteristics of colour.</dd>
			<dt> Line</dt>
			<dd> Line is a mark made by a pointed tool -brush, pencil, stick, pen, etc- and is often defined as a moving dot. 
			It can vary in width, direction, curvature, length, and even colour. A line is created by the movement of a tool and 
			pigment, and often suggests movement in a drawing or painting.</dd>
			<dt> Value</dt>
			<dd>Value refers to dark and light; the value scale refers to black and white with all gradations of gray in between. 
			Value contrasts help us to see and understand a two-dimensional work of art. Value contrast is also evident in colours, 
			which enables us to read shapes in paintings. </dd>
			<dt> Texture</dt>
			<dd> Texture refers to the surface quality, both simulated and actual, of artwork. Techniques used in painting serve to 
			show texture, i.e. the dry brush technique produces a rough simulated quality and heavy application of pigment with brush 
			or other implement produces a rough actual quality.</dd>
			<dt>Shape </dt>
			<dd> Shape is an area that is contained within an implied line, or is seen and identified because of colour or value changes. 
			Shapes have two-dimensions, length and width, and can be geometric or free form. Design is basically the planned arrangement 
			of shapes in a work of art.</dd>
			<dt> Form</dt>
			<dd> Shape and form have the same qualities except shape is two-dimensional and form is three-dimension all; 
			it describes volume and mass. Both may be organic or inorganic, free form or geometric, open or closed, natural or man-made.</dd>
			<dt> Space</dt>
			<dd>Actual space is a three- dimensional volume that can be empty or filled with objects. It has width, height, and depth. 
			Space in a painting is an illusion that crates a feeling of depth. The object or the picture plane is divided into positive space 
			(the object itself ) and negative space ( the surrounding area). Various techniques can be used to show space.</dd>
